# Dataset
The dataset given is an array of transaction graphs.
Each transaction graph has an array of children which are also transaction graphs (hint: recursion).
Every child transaction has a connectionInfo which describes how they are connected with the immediate parent.
connectionInfo has confidence and type:
Type stores the connection type and can have values like sameEmail, sameGeoInfo etc.
Confidence can be between 0 to 1, 1 indicates that we are 100% sure this transaction is connected to the immediate parent, .6 means we are 60% sure and so on...

# Workflow
Create the following API endpoint:
GET /api/transactions?transactionId={transactionId}&confidenceLevel={confidence}
The request should return a list of transactions, containing the transaction with the transactionId query param, along with all its children that have a connection confidence same or bigger than the confidenceLevel query param. This should be a flattened structure.
Important:
There can be multiple levels of children, and children of children are also connected transactions to the main parent
The transactionId can be of any transaction in the provided graph, meaning that it can be of a child transaction as well, and in that case you should return that transaction, along with its children (if any), always taking the confidence level into account
The transaction with the same ID as in the query param should not contain the connectionInfo property, only the other connected transactions
Add a property in the transactions, called combinedConnectionInfo, which should follow this structure: 1) each child combinedConnectionInfo confidence is calculated based on the multiplication of its own connectionInfo confidence with its parent’s connectionInfo confidence (for first level connections, the parent’s confidence will always be 1 - the transaction with the transactionId itself). 2) The combinedConnectionInfo types should be a list of strings containing the connectionInfo type present in the transaction, along with all of the connectionInfo types present in the parents, until getting to the main transaction of transactionId in the query param (first level children will only have a single type, and the others have multiple) 
Deploy your api and send us the link (your choice of cloud platform, Heroku for example is fine)
You are done! Please send us your solution (source code) and the deployed API endpoint and we will get in touch :)

# Requirements
Use NodeJS for backend (Typescript preferred)
Authentication is not required for this task
Make sure your code is clean & well formatted as per industry standards.
Please write a Readme containing the instructions to run the code, along with any other info you may find necessary
For the data, make sure to use the test data json file that you are provided with, please don’t edit that file
